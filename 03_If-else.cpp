//This is a simple program to TAKE INPUT FROM USERS AND PRINT THE LARGEST VALUE AMONG THEM! This is a simple approach to the problem.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std; //thse two lines are common and required in all teh programs

int main() {
int a,b; //here we are defining two inputs that are going to be integer. Use "char" for string values
cout << "Enter two numbers : " <<endl; //asking the users to enter two input numbers
cin >>a >>b; //assigning the input values to a and b
cout << "You have entered " <<a <<" and " <<b <<endl; //printing the numbers provided as input by the user
if(a>b){ //writing the first condition to check whether a is greater than b
  cout << "The largest number is : " << a <<endl; //if the condition is satisfied, output is printed
  }
else{
  cout <<" The largest number is : " <<b <<endl; //program will print this as output if the condition is not met above
}
